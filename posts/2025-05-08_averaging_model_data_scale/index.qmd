title: "Regression: Averaging on the model vs. data scale"
subtitle: "Obstacles to replication in corpus linguistics"
description: "This blog post is part of a small series on obstacles to replication in corpus linguistics. It deals with problems that can arise if the observations drawn from a corpus are unbalanced across relevant subgroups in the data. I show how simple and comparative data summaries can vary depending on whether we (unintentionally) calculate weighted averages, or whether we adjust our estimates for imbalances by taking a simple average across subgroups. As these are two different estimands, the choice affects the comparability of studies -- including an original study and its direct replication."
